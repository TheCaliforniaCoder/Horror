# Project: Rick and Morty API List

## Description

This is my first project using React as part of the SEI General Assembly Course. The task was to create a web application using ReactJS and an API of your choice that met the requirements of a provided specification. I chose to display a list of characters from the Rick and Morty API and implement full CRUD actions so that the user can Create, Read, Update and Delete characters from the list. I also included a search function so that users can find characters quickly.

## Technical Requirements

   * Add a new item to a list.
   * Mark the item as complete/favorite/(watch, read, listen) later/flag/etc.
   * Edit an item from a list.
   * Remove an item from a list.
   * Clear/delete all items.
   * Clear/delete only marked items.
   * Fetch data from at least one 3rd party API using Axios or fetch.

### Bonus Features

   * Allow user to search for characters within list.

## Timeframe & Team
   
   We were given a week to complete this solo assignment. 
   
## Technologies Used

  * **Code Editor:** VSCode
  * **Programming Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSX
  * **JS-Libaries:** React, Axios
  * **Version Control:** Git & Git Hub Source Control
   
## Planning 

   * I started by looking for an appropriate API.
   * I created a To-Do list to keep track of tasks.
   * I created a basic template of the list in React and then started building my components.

## Build/Code Process

   With one week for development, I focused on delivering the core technical requirements while ensuring the page and code could scale to the optional extras. After choosing the Rick and Morty API and forming the necessary components, I began with making the API call.
   
   * My first API call:

   This was my first time using axios to make an API call. Excited to do many more!
   
   Most of my time was spent executing CRUD actions on characters: Create, Read, Update, & Delete etc.
   
   * Add, Update and Delete Functions:

   * Handle Search Function:

   This was a bonus feature that made the page more user friendly.
   
## Challenges

Selecting an appropriate API proved to be the biggest obstacle, and it took me two days of the seven-day project to scour for the ideal one. This task educated me on how to thoroughly comprehend API documentation. Additionally, I initially struggled to comprehend the organization of the various components but eventually improved my understanding. Overall, I encountered difficulties determining where to commence, but I tackled the task methodically.
     
## Wins
   
   Besides finishing on time, I'd say the biggest win is learning how to create a React app using an API. I even surprised myself by tackling one of the      additional features: the search function.
      
## Key Learnings & Takeaways
  
   * Using my time more effecienty: spend less time on insignificant factors.
   * KISS: keep it simple stupid. Don't bite off more than I can chew.
   * In general I feel as though this was the practice I needed in React.

## Future Improvements

   Going forward, I'd like to re-design the overall layout of the page and structure it differently. Users will also be allowed to upload an image for the characters they add.
