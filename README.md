## User Stories

   * Add a new item to a list
   * Mark the item as complete/favorite/(watch, read, listen) later/flag/etc
   * Edit an item from a list
   * Remove an item from a list
   * Clear/delete all items
   * Clear/delete only marked items
   * Fetch data from at least one 3rd party API using Axios or fetch.

### Bonus Features

   * Allow user to search for characters within list 

## Timeframe & Team
   
   We were given a week to complete this solo assignment. 
   
## Technologies Used

  * ReactJS
  * Axios
  * HTML
  * Pure CSS
   
## Planning 

   * I started by looking for an appropriate API
   * I created a To-Do list to keep track of tasks
   * I created a basic template of the list in React and then started fleshing out my components

## Build/Code Process

   After I found an API that fit, I started creating all the necessary components. 
   I went through the requirements added functions accordingly.
   I then went through each feature and looked for the best way to implement them.
   
   * My first API call:

   This was my first time using axios to make an API call. Excited to do many more!
   
   * Handle Search Function:

   This was a bonus feature that made the page more user friendly.
   
## Challenges
   
   The main challenge I faced was choosing a proper API. I spent two out of the five days browsing for the right one.
   I also couldn't understand the hierarchy of the components but gained a better understanding towards the end.
   In general, I had trouble knowing where to start but took it one step at a time.
     
## Wins
   
   Besides finishing on time, I'd say the biggest win is learning how to create a React app using an API.
      
## Key Learnings & Takeaways
  
   * Using my time more effecienty: spend less time on insignificant factors.
   * Placing code snippets in the correct place, (it sounds funny but I gained  EVEN MORE clarity with order in function).
   * KISS: keep it simple stupid. Don't bite off more than I can chew.
   * In general I feel as though this was the practice I needed in React.

## Future Improvements

   Going forward, I'll structure my time more effeciently by spending more time on the core functionality as opposed to searching for API's.
   I'll test as I go more often and get feeback as I progress!
